Webscrape GPU and HD

Here is the new program made by Steve as a side project.

Overview:
This is a script to get prices of Graphics card & Hard drives. It is currently a work in progress.

Note: The open function does not work unless you have installed the os module for python, so it will not open the file regardless of the response given.
It will instead create a new file and combine those two files created in a seperate csv file. 


Instructions to unzip the file:

1. Right click on the file, click on extract all.

2. Contact me to attain the password to open the file

3. The file should be extracted onto your desktop.

If you cannot unzip the file, try downloading 7zip and extract it using that software.
