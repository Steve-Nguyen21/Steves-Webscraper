Webscrape GPU and HD for new-eggs website

Here is the new program made by Steve as a side project.

Overview:
This is a script to get prices of Graphics card & Hard drives from New-egg. Once it gets the price, it'll ask you whether you'd like to open up the file or not. If answered "Yes", it'll automatically open the file for you to view. It also allows you to send an email with the files attached to whoever you'd like.
