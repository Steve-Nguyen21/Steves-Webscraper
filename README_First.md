Here is the new program made by Steve as a side project.

Overview:
This is a script to get prices of Graphics card & Hard drives. It is currently a work in progress.

It will instead, create a new file and combine those two files created in a seperate csv file. You can open these files using excel. 

You must enable your gmail account to allow third party access to send an email using your own.

Instructions to unzip the file:

1. Right click on the zipped file, click extract file here. (under 7zip)

2. It should prompt for a password. Contact me to obtain the password to open the file

3. After entering the password, the file should be extracted onto your desktop/folder as an exe file.
